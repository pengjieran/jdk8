<h2><a name="architecture" id="architecture"></a>Architecture</h2>
<h3><a name="jre" id="jre"></a>Java Runtime Environment</h3>
<p>With the Java Plug-in, applets are not run in the JVM inside the
browser. Instead, they are executed in a separate process. The same
JVM process can be shared between multiple applets, or applets may
be placed into different processes depending on whether the
existing JVMs match the applet requirements and have enough
resources to execute the applet. An applet can request specific
version of JRE to be used and can specify what options need to be
passed to the JVM. An applet can also request to be executed in the
separate JVM.</p>
<p><img src="../images/jre_and_browser.jpg" alt=

"452" height="522" /></p>
<p>The browser and the applet can still communicate with one
another, however. Existing APIs have been re-engineered to use
process sockets, so things continue to work as they did
before, only better. This architecture provides a number of
benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applets that require different versions of the JRE can run
simultaneously.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Applets can specify JRE start-up parameters such as heap size.
(A new applet uses an existing JRE if it's requirements are a
subset of an existing JRE, otherwise, a new JRE instance is
launched.);</li>
<li>The message-passing interfaces are written in Java, so they run
on all supported platforms, in the same way, so
cross-browser compatibility is enhanced.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that architecture, a new JRE can be launched whenever it is
needed. But an applet will run in an existing JRE as long as:</p>
<ol>
<li type="a">The JRE version required by the applet matches an
existing JRE, and</li>
<li type="a">The JRE's launch parameters satisfy the applet's
requirements</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If two applets each require a large amount of memory, they
might both run in the same JRE, causing one of them to run out of
memory. But that's only a concern when you have multiple applets
running simultaneously.</p></li>
<li><p>Particular versions of JRE can be marked as unavailable to the
plugin by disabling them in the Java Control Panel.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="jreVersion" id="jreVersion"></a>Java Runtime
Environment Version Selection</h3>

<p>On all platforms, the Java Plug-in locates JREs to use from
the entries listed in the Java Control Panel ("Java" tab, "View"
button). The available JREs in
this list are encoded in the <code>deployment.properties</code>
file whose location is platform-dependent. On the Windows platform,
it is generally located in <code>C:\Users\[username]\AppData\LocalLow\Sun\Java\Deployment</code>. On
Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms, it is generally located in
<code>~/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</code>.</p>
<p>On Windows platforms, both the Java Control Panel and the
Java Plug-in will automatically detect the installed JREs and add
them to the available set. On Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms, auto-detection of
installed JREs is not supported. The Java Runtime Environment Settings
dialog, which is accessed by clicking View in the Java tab of the Java Control 
Panel, may be used to manually add JREs
to the known list for the Java Plug-in.</p>
<p>By default, the Java Plug-in will execute all applets in the
latest JRE version named in this list. It will only execute an
applet on an earlier JRE version if explicitly requested.</p>
<p>When considering a request to launch an applet on a specific JRE
version (for example, a particular update release like
"1.5.0_11"):</p>
<ol>
<li>The list of available JREs is consulted. If there is an exact
match of the version string, that JRE version is selected.
Otherwise, if there are one or more installed JREs in the same
family, the latest version is selected. Otherwise, the latest
available JRE on the machine is selected.</li>
<li>The selected JRE version is compared against the security
baseline for the family. (See <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/family-clsid-140615.html">Deploying Java Applets With Family JRE Versions in Java Plug-in for Internet Explorer</a> for more information.) If it is equal to or more recent than
that version, no further prompting is done and the applet is
launched.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the code for the applet is downloaded in a JVM
instance of the selected JRE version. If the applet is signed and
the user accepts the security dialog for the applet (or the code
source has already been trusted), no further prompting is done and
the applet is launched.</li>
<li>Otherwise, we are dealing with an unsigned applet on an "older"
JRE version. A dialog box is presented indicating that this applet
is requesting to run on top of an older JRE release, and asks the
user whether he or she wants to allow it to. If the user clicks
"yes", the applet is launched. If the user clicks "no", the applet
is re-launched on top of the latest available JRE version.</li>
</ol>
<p>When considering a request to launch an applet on a particular
family, the most recent JRE from that family will be selected and
the above steps starting from (2) will be followed.</p>
<p>When considering a request to launch an applet on a particular
family or any later family, the latest available JRE will be used
to launch the applet.</p>
<h3><b><a name="threads" id="threads"></a></b>Thread
Considerations</h3>
<p>A web browser's JavaScript interpreter engine is single thread.
The Java Plug-in is capable of managing multiple threads. The Java
Plug-in creates a separate worker thread for every applet. Applets
themselves may be multi-threaded. Applets making JavaScript to Java
calls and vice versa should be designed with the thread related
issues in mind.</p>
<p>The following picture shows the thread interactions between the
JavaScript Interpreter, Java Plug-in and an applet (i.e. Java).</p>
<p><img src="../images/LiveConnectThreadInteraction.jpg" alt=
"JavaScript Interpreter, Java Plug-in and Applet Thread Interactions"
width="709" height="535" /></p>
<p>When the JavaScript interpreter is idle, the Java Plug-in
executes a JavaScript to Java call on the per applet worker thread
(JavaScript Interpreter Not Busy scenario).</p>
<p>When a Java to Javascript call is in progress and a JavaScript
to Java call is made, the latter is executed on the same thread
that made the Java to JavaScript call (Round Trip scenario).</p>
<p>When a thread is executing a Java to JavaScript call, another
thread wanting to do the same will be blocked till the first thread
has received its result and is done (JavaScript Interpreter Busy
scenario)</p>
<p>In order to avoid thread related issues especially when multiple
applets are running simultaneously, keep both Java to JavaScript
and JavaScript to Java calls short and avoid round trips, if
possible.</p>
<h3><a name="cache" id="cache"></a>Classloader Cache and
Interaction between Applets</h3>
<p>Normally, if two applets have the same <code>codebase</code> and
<code>archive</code> parameters, they will be loaded by the same
class loader instance. This behavior is required for backward
compatibility, and is relied on by several real-world applications.
The result is that multiple applets on the same web page may access
each others' static variables at the Java language level,
effectively allowing the multiple applets to be written as though
they comprised a single application.</p>
<p>While this feature enables certain kinds of applications to be
conveniently written, it has certain drawbacks. It interferes with
termination of applets, in particular when multiple instances of
the same applet are active. It makes the programming model for
applets more complex, since it is under specified exactly when the
static fields of an applet will be re-initialized, and when they
will be maintained from run to run of the same applet. It causes
imprecise behavior of certain user interface operations within the
Java Plug-in due to the inability to identify exactly which applet
initiated a particular request.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Java Plug-in provides a way to opt out
of the use of the <a href=
"applet_deployment.html#CLASSLOADER_CACHE">classloader cache</a> on
an applet by applet basis.</p>
<h3><a name="gc" id="gc"></a>Applet Garbage Collection</h3>
<p>Garbage collection occurs on an applet instance immediately
after the <code>destroy</code> method finishes. The garbage
collection applies to all memory acquired by the applet, <i>except
for static variables</i>. Statics are preserved in the classloader
cache, along with the classes themselves, for as long as the class
loader is present.</p>
<p>So when does the class loader go away? That behavior is not
specified. It's up to the implementation of the Java virtual
machine and its interactions with the operating system. You can
expect it be retained for as long as possible, but to be discarded
when the memory is needed for other purposes.</p>
<h3><a name="privileges" id="privileges"></a>Applet Privileges</h3>
<p>All applets should be signed with a certificate from a recognized certificate 
authority. The user must agree to run an applet and having a valid certificate 
provides the user with some assurance that the applet is safe to run. An applet 
runs in a secure sandbox that prevents it from
interacting with the users system, unless authorized. To obtain
that authorization, the applet must request permissions when it is launched and 
the user must agree to run the applet. Permissions
are needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print</li>
<li>Access the file system</li>
<li>Access browser cookies</li>
<li>Access other system resources</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic applet security model is an all or nothing
proposition. An applet with permissions has full access to the user's system. 
Without permissions, the applet has
virtually no access at all.</p>
<p>Deployment of applets using JNLP allows them to avail a more
fine-grained security model (similar to Java Web Start
applications), that gives them controlled access to a user's
system, under control of the user. (For example, the ability to
save or open a file selected by the user and the ability to
print.)</p>
