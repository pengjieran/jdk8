<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Java Plug-in technology (hereafter the "Java Plug-in"),
which is included in the Java Runtime Environment, enables Java
applets to run in popular web browsers on the desktop. The Java Plug-in
provides powerful new capabilities to applets in the web browser,
while improving the overall reliability and functionality of
applets in a backward-compatible manner.</p>

<p>The Java Plug-in runs one or more
Java virtual machine instances (JVMs) that connect back to the
browser for full interoperability with the surrounding web page.
This architectural change offers many advantages and features:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>The JVM running the applet is
isolated from the web browser at the operating system level. If
something should go wrong while running the applet, or if an
uncooperative applet refuses to shut down, the Java Plug-in
detects and handles the error condition gracefully; the web browser
is unaffected.</p>

<p>The Java Plug-in starts
applets in the background, so the web browser always remains
responsive. Applets appear on the web page as they become ready to
run.</p>


</li>

<li><p>The Java Plug-in offers the
capability to launch applets directly from JNLP files, unifying
deployment of Java content both in the browser and out of the
browser (via Java Web Start). Developers can reuse JNLP
extensions for advanced functionality including <a href=
"http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/">Java Binding for the OpenGL API (JOGL)</a> and
<a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/">NASA World Wind</a> (planetary-scale
terrain visualization) within applets. Applets can access
JNLP APIs for persistent data storage, local file system access,
and other useful functionality from sandboxed code.</p></li>

<li><p>The bridge
between the JavaScript engine in the web browser and the Java
programming language is backward-compatible and features exceptional
reliability, performance, and cross-browser portability for both
Java calling JavaScript as well as JavaScript calling Java.
Formerly Mozilla-specific "LiveConnect" functionality, such as the
ability to call static Java methods, instantiate new Java objects
and reference third-party packages from JavaScript, is available in all browsers.</p></li>

<li><p>Applets can utilize as much heap space as command-line applications.</p></li>


<li><p>JVM command-line
arguments may be specified in the HTML of the web page on a
per-applet basis, providing fine-grained control over options such
as the heap size and Java 2D hardware acceleration features.</p></li>

<li><p>Each individual applet
instance may request a different JRE version on which to run. This
feature is designed for enterprise customers who prefer to
qualify their applets against either a particular JRE version or a
particular JRE family. Both selection of a specific JRE version, or
any in a particular family, are supported in the Java
Plug-in.</p></li>

</ul>
