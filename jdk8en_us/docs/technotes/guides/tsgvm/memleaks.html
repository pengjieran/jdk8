<h1><span>3</span> Troubleshooting Memory Leaks</h1>
<p>This chapter provides some suggestions on diagnosing problems involving possible memory leaks.</p>
<p>If your application's execution time becomes longer and longer, or if the operating system (OS) seems to be performing slower and slower, this could be an indication of a memory leak. In other words, virtual memory is being allocated but is not being returned when it is no longer needed. Eventually the application or the system runs out of memory, and the application terminates abnormally.</p>

<h2>Understanding the <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> Exception</h2>
<p>One common indication of a memory leak is the <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code> exception. This error is thrown when there is insufficient space to allocate an object in the Java heap or in a particular area of the heap. The garbage collector cannot make any further space available to accommodate a new object, and the heap cannot be expanded further.</p>
<p>When the <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code> exception is thrown, a stack trace is printed also.</p>
<p>The <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code> exception can also be thrown by native library code when a native allocation cannot be satisfied (for example, if swap space is low).</p>
<p>An early step to diagnose an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> exception is to determine the cause of the exception. Was it thrown because the Java heap is full, or because the native heap is full? To help you find the cause, the text of the exception includes a detail message at the end. Below are several examples of the <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code> exception.</p>
<div><a id="tahiti1149887" name="tahiti1149887"/>
<div>
<dl>
<dt><span><a id="sthref39" name="sthref39"/>Exception in thread <span>thread_name</span>: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</span> </dt>
<dd>
<div><span>Cause:</span> The detail message "Java heap space" indicates that an object could not be allocated in the Java heap. This error does not necessarily imply a memory leak. The problem can be as simple as a configuration issue, where the specified heap size (or the default size, if it is not specified) is insufficient for the application.
<p>In other cases, and in particular for a long-lived application, the message might be an indication that the application is unintentionally holding references to objects, and this prevents the objects from being garbage collected. This is the Java language equivalent of a memory leak. Note that APIs that are called by an application could also be unintentionally holding object references.</p>
<p>One other potential source of this error arises with applications that make excessive use of finalizers. If a class has a <code>finalize</code> method, then objects of that type do not have their space reclaimed at garbage collection time. Instead, after garbage collection, the objects are queued for finalization, which occurs at a later time. In the Sun implementation, finalizers are executed by a daemon thread that services the finalization queue. If the finalizer thread cannot keep up with the finalization queue, then the Java heap could fill up and this type of the <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> exception would be thrown. One scenario that can cause this situation is when an application creates high-priority threads that cause the finalization queue to increase at a rate that is faster than the rate at which the finalizer thread is servicing that queue.</p>

<div><span>Cause:</span> The detail message "PermGen space" indicates that the permanent generation is full. The permanent generation is the area of the heap where class and method objects are stored.
<p>When this kind of error occurs, the text <code>ClassLoader.defineClass</code> might appear near the top of the stack trace that is printed.</p>

<p>Interned <code>java.lang.String</code> objects are no longer stored in the permanent generation. The <code>java.lang.String</code> class maintains a pool of strings. When the <code>java.lang.String.intern()</code> method is invoked, the method checks the pool to see if an equal string is already in the pool. If there is, then the <code>intern()</code> method returns it; otherwise it adds the string to the pool. In more precise terms, the <code>intern()</code> method is used to obtain the canonical representation of the string. The result is a reference to the same class instance that would be returned if that string appeared as a literal.</p>

<p>The <code>jmap -permgen</code> command prints statistics for the objects in the permanent generation and also information about internalized String instances.

<dt><span><a id="sthref41" name="sthref41"/>Exception in thread <span>thread_name</span>: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Requested array size exceeds VM limit</span> </dt>
<dd>
<div><span>Cause:</span> The detail message "Requested array size exceeds VM limit" indicates that the application (or APIs used by that application) attempted to allocate an array that is larger than the heap size. For example, if an application attempts to allocate an array of 512MB but the maximum heap size is 256MB then <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> will be thrown with the reason "Requested array size exceeds VM limit".</div>
</dd>
<dd>
<div><span>Action:</span> In most cases the problem is either a configuration issue (heap size too small), or a bug that results in an application attempting to create a huge array (for example, when the number of elements in the array is computed using an algorithm that computes an incorrect size).</div>

<dd>
<div><span>Cause:</span> The detail message "request <span>size</span> bytes for <span>reason</span>. Out of swap space?" appears to be an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> exception. However, the HotSpot VM code reports this apparent exception when an allocation from the native heap failed and the native heap might be close to exhaustion. The message indicates the size (in bytes) of the request that failed and the reason for the memory request. In most cases the reason is the name of the source module reporting the allocation failure, although in some cases it indicates the actual reason.</div>
</dd>
<dd>
<div><span>Action:</span> When this error message is thrown, the VM invokes the fatal error handling mechanism (that is, it generates a fatal error log file, which contains useful information about the thread, process, and system at the time of the crash). In the case of native heap exhaustion, the heap memory and memory map information in the log can be useful. For more information on understanding the fatal error log file, see <a href="felog.html#fatal_error_log_vm">"Fatal Error Log"</a>.
<p>If this type of the <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> exception is thrown, you might need to use troubleshooting utilities on the OS to diagnose the issue further.

<dd>
<div><span>Cause:</span> If the detail part of the error message is "<span>reason</span> <span>stack_trace_with_native_method</span>" and a stack trace is printed in which the top frame is a native method, then this is an indication that a native method has encountered an allocation failure. The difference between this and the previous message is that the allocation failure was detected in a Java Native Interface (JNI) or native method rather than in the Java VM code.</div>
</dd>

<div><span>Action:</span> If this type of the <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> exception is thrown, you might need to use native utilities of the OS to further diagnose the issue.

<div>
<h2>Crash Instead of <code>OutOfMemoryError</code></h2>
<p>Sometimes an application crashes soon after an allocation from the native heap fails. This occurs with native code that does not check for errors returned by memory allocation functions.</p>
<p>For example, the malloc system call returns <code>null</code> if there is no memory available. If the return from malloc is not checked, then the application might crash when it attempts to access an invalid memory location. Depending on the circumstances, this type of issue can be difficult to locate.</p>
<p>However, in some cases the information from the fatal error log or the crash dump might be sufficient to diagnose this issue. The fatal error log is covered in detail in Appendix C, Fatal Error Log. If the cause of the crash is determined to be a failure to check an allocation failure, then the reason for the allocation failure must be examined. As with any other native heap issue, the system might be configured with insufficient swap space, another process on the system might be consuming all memory resources, or there might be a leak in the application (or in the APIs that it calls) that causes the system to run out of memory.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing Leaks in Java Language Code</h2>
<p>Diagnosing leaks in Java language code can be a difficult task. In most cases it requires very detailed knowledge of the application. In addition the process is often iterative and lengthy. This section provides information on the tools you can use to diagnose memory leaks in Java language code.</p>

<p>Besides the tools mentioned in this section, there are a large number of third-party memory debuggers available.

<p><b>The NetBeans Profiler</b></p>
<p>The NetBeans Profiler (previously known as JFluid) is an excellent profiler, which can locate memory leaks very quickly. Most commercial memory leak debugging tools can often take a long time to locate a leak in a large application. The NetBeans Profiler, however, uses the pattern of memory allocations and reclamations that such objects typically demonstrate. This process includes also the lack of memory reclamations. The profiler can check where these objects were allocated, which in many cases is sufficient to identify the root cause of the leak.</p>
<p>More details can be found at <code><a href="http://profiler.netbeans.org">http://profiler.netbeans.org</a></code>.</p>
<a id="sthref45" name="sthref45"/>
<p><b>The <code>jhat</code> Utility</b></p>
<p>The <code>jhat</code> utility is useful when debugging unintentional object retention (or memory leaks). It provides a way to browse an object dump, view all reachable objects in the heap, and understand which references are keeping an object alive.</p>
<p>To use <code>jhat</code> you must obtain one or more heap dumps of the running application, and the dumps must be in binary format. Once the dump file is created, it can be used as input to <code>jhat</code>. See <a href="tooldescr.html#jhat">"The <code>jhat</code> Utility"</a>.</p>
<div><a id="sthref46" name="sthref46"/>
<h3>Creating a Heap Dump</h3>
<p>A heap dump provides detailed information on the allocation of heap memory. There are several ways to create a heap dump:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HPROF can create a heap dump if it is launched together with the application. The following is an example of the command:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
$ java -agentlib:hprof=file=snapshot.hprof,format=b <span>application</span>
</pre>
<div align="center">
<div><br/>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" frame="hsides" rules="groups" summary="" width="80%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>If the JVM is embedded or is not started using a command-line launcher that allows additional options to be provided, then it might be possible to use the <code>JAVA_TOOLS_OPTIONS</code> environment variable so that the <code>-agentlib</code> option is automatically added to the command line. See <a href="envvars.html#BCFBGHFG">"The <code>JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS</code> Environment Variable"</a> for further information on this environment variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/></div>
</div>
<p>Once the application is running with HPROF, a heap dump can be created by pressing Control+\ or Control+Break (depending on the platform) in the application console. An alternative approach on Solaris OS and Linux is to send a QUIT signal with the <code>kill -QUIT</code> <span>pid</span> command. When the signal is received, a heap dump is created for the process with the specified PID; in the above example the file snapshot.hprof will be created.</p>
<p>The heap dump file contains all the primitive data and stack traces.</p>
<p>A dump file can contain multiple heap dumps. If Control+\ or Control+Break is pressed a number of times then subsequent dumps are appended to the file. The <code>jhat</code> utility uses the <code>#n</code> syntax to distinguish the dumps, where <code>n</code> is the dump number. See <a href="tooldescr.html#hprof">"HPROF"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>jmap</code> utility can be used to create a heap dump of a running process. The following is an example of the command:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
$ jmap -dump:format=b,file=snapshot.jmap <span>pid</span>
</pre>
<p>Regardless of how the Java VM was started, the <code>jmap</code> tool will produce a head dump snapshot, in the above example in a file named snapshot.jmap. The <code>jmap</code> output files should contain all the primitive data, but will not include any stack traces showing where the objects have been created. See <a href="tooldescr.html#jmap">"The <code>jmap</code> Utility"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way to create a heap dump is using the JConsole utility. For this, in the <b>MBeans</b> tab, select the <b>HotSpotDiagnostic</b> MBean, then the <b>Operations</b> display, and choose the <b>dumpHeap</b> operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you specify the <code>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</code> command-line option while running your application, then when an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> exception is thrown, the JVM will generate a heap dump.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div><a id="sthref47" name="sthref47"/>
<h3>Obtaining a Heap Histogram</h3>
<p>You can try to quickly narrow down a memory leak by examining the heap histogram. It can be obtained in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the Java process is started with the <code>-XX:+PrintClassHistogram</code> command-line option, then the Control+Break handler will produce a heap histogram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the <code>jmap</code> utility to obtain a heap histogram from a running process:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
jmap -histo <span>pid</span>
</pre>
<p>The output shows the total size and instance count for each class type in the heap. If a sequence of histograms is obtained (for example, every 2 minutes), then you might be able to observe a trend that can lead to further analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the <code>jmap</code> utility to obtain a heap histogram from a core file:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
jmap -histo <span>core_file</span>
</pre>
<p>For example, if you specify the <code>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</code> command-line option while running your application, then when an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> exception is thrown, the JVM will generate a heap dump. You can then execute <code>jmap</code> on the core file to get a histogram, as in the following example:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
$ <code><span>jmap -histo \ /java/re/javase/6/latest/binaries/solaris-sparc/bin/java core.27421</span></code>

<p>The example shows that the <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> exception was caused by the number of <code>java.lang.String</code> objects (3,611,828 instances in the heap). Without further analysis it is not clear where the strings are allocated. However, the information is still useful and the investigation can continue with tools such as <code>HPROF</code> and <code>jhat</code> to find where the strings are allocated, as well as what references are keeping them alive and preventing them from being garbage collected.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="CIHHFDFB" name="CIHHFDFB"/>
<div>
<h3>Monitoring the Number of Objects Pending Finalization</h3>
<p>When the OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown with the "Java heap space" detail message, the cause can be excessive use of finalizers. To diagnose this, you have several options for monitoring the number of objects that are pending finalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The JConsole management tool (see <a href="tooldescr.html#jconsole">"JConsole"</a>) can be used to monitor the number of objects that are pending finalization. This tool reports the pending finalization count in the memory statistics on the <b>Summary</b> tab pane. The count is approximate but it can be used to characterize an application and understand if it relies a lot on finalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Solaris OS and Linux, the <code>jmap</code> utility can be used with the <code>-finalizerinfo</code> option to print information on objects awaiting finalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application can report the approximate number of objects pending finalization using the <code>getObjectPendingFinalizationCount</code> method of the <code>java.lang.management.MemoryMXBean</code> class. Links to the API documentation and example code can be found in <a href="tooldescr.html#custom_diagnostic_tools">"Custom Diagnostic Tools"</a>. The example code can easily be extended to include the reporting of the pending finalization count.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<a id="A1000434" name="A1000434"/>
<div>
<h2>Diagnosing Leaks in Native Code</h2>
<p>Several techniques can be used to find and isolate native code memory leaks. In general there is no single ideal solution for all platforms.</p>
<div><a id="sthref48" name="sthref48"/>
<h3>Tracking All Memory Allocation and Free Calls</h3>
<p>A very common practice is to track all allocation and free calls of the native allocations. This can be a fairly simple process or a very sophisticated one. Many products over the years have been built up around the tracking of native heap allocations and the use of that memory.</p>
<p>Tools like Purify and the Run Time Checking functionality of Sun's <code>dbx</code> debugger can be used to find these leaks in normal native code situations and also find any access to native heap memory that represents assignments to uninitialized memory or accesses to freed memory. See <a href="#dbx_find_leaks">"Using the <code>dbx</code> Debugger to Find Leaks"</a>.</p>
<p>Not all these types of tools will work with Java applications that use native code, and usually these tools are platform-specific. Since the virtual machine dynamically creates code at runtime, these tools can wrongly interpret the code and fail to run at all, or give false information. Check with your tool vendor to make sure the version of the tool works with the version of the virtual machine you are using.</p>
<p>Many simple and portable native memory leak detecting examples can be found at <code><a href="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</a></code>. Most of these libraries and tools assume that you can recompile or edit the source of the application and place wrapper functions over the allocation functions. The more powerful of these tools allow you to run your application unchanged by interposing over these allocation functions dynamically. This is the case with the library libumem.so, first introduced in Solaris 9 OS update 3; see <a href="#libumem_find_leaks">"Using the libumem Tool to Find Leaks"</a>.</p>
</div>

<div><a id="sthref49" name="sthref49"/>
<h3>Tracking Memory Allocation in a JNI Library</h3>
<p>If you write a JNI library, it would probably be wise to create some kind of localized way to make sure your library does not leak memory, using a simple wrapper approach.</p>
<p>The following procedure is an easy localized allocation tracking approach for a JNI library. First, define the following lines in all source files:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#define malloc(n) debug_malloc(n, __FILE__, __LINE__)
#define free(p) debug_free(p, __FILE__, __LINE__)
</pre>
<p>Then you can use the following functions to watch for leaks.</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
/* Total bytes allocated */
static int total_allocated;
/* Memory alignment is important */
typedef union { double d; struct {size_t n; char *file; int line;} s; } Site;
void *
debug_malloc(size_t n, char *file, int line) 
{ 
    char *rp;
    rp = (char*)malloc(sizeof(Site)+n); 
    total_allocated += n; 
    ((Site*)rp)-&gt;s.n = n;
    ((Site*)rp)-&gt;s.file = file;
    ((Site*)rp)-&gt;s.line = line;
    return (void*)(rp + sizeof(Site));
}
void 
debug_free(void *p, char *file, int line)
{
    char *rp;
    rp = ((char*)p) - sizeof(Site);
    total_allocated -= ((Site*)rp)-&gt;s.n;
    free(rp);
}
</pre>
<p>The JNI library would then need to periodically (or at shutdown) check the value of the <code>total_allocated</code> variable to make sure that it made sense. The above code could also be expanded to save in a linked list the allocations that remained and report where the leaked memory was allocated. This is a localized and portable way to track memory allocations in a single set of sources. You would need to make sure that <code>debug_free()</code> was called only with the pointer that came from <code>debug_malloc()</code>, and you would also need to create similar functions for <code>realloc()</code>, <code>calloc()</code>, <code>strdup()</code>, and so forth, if they were used.</p>
<p>A more global way to look for native heap memory leaks would involve interposition of the library calls for the entire process.</p>
</div>

<div><a id="sthref50" name="sthref50"/>
<h3>Tracking Memory Allocation With OS Support</h3>
<p>Most operating systems include some form of global allocation tracking support.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Windows, search the MSDN library at <code><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library</a></code> for debug support. The Microsoft C++ compiler has the <code>/Md</code> and <code>/Mdd</code> compiler options that will automatically include extra support for tracking memory allocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux systems have tools such as <code>mtrace</code> and <code>libnjamd</code> to help in dealing with allocation tracking.</p>

<p>The output shows that the <code>dbx</code> debugger reports memory leaks if memory is not freed at the time the process is about to exit. However, memory that is allocated at initialization time and needed for the life of the process is often never freed in native code. Therefore, in such cases the <code>dbx</code> debugger can report memory leaks that are not leaks in reality.</p>
<p>Note that the example used two <code>suppress</code> commands to suppress the leaks reported in the virtual machine (libjvm.so) and the Java support library (libjava.so).</p>

<h3>Using the libumem Tool to Find Leaks</h3>
<p>First introduced in Solaris 9 OS update 3, the libumem.so library and the modular debugger <code>mdb</code> can be used to debug memory leaks. Before using <code>libumem</code>, you must preload the <code>libumem</code> library and set an environment variable as follows:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
$ LD_PRELOAD=libumem.so
$ export LD_PRELOAD
$ UMEM_DEBUG=default
$ export UMEM_DEBUG
</pre>
<p>Now, run the Java application but stop it before it exits. The following example uses <code>truss</code> to stop the process when it calls the <code>_exit</code> system call:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
$ truss -f -T _exit java MainClass <span>arguments</span>
</pre>
<p>At this point you can attach the <code>mdb</code> debugger, as follows:</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
$ <code><span>mdb -p </span></code><code><span>pid</span></code>
&gt;<code><span>::findleaks</span></code>
</pre>
<p>The <code>::findleaks</code> command is the <code>mdb</code> command to find memory leaks. If a leak is found, the <code>findleaks</code> command prints the address of the allocation call, buffer address, and nearest symbol.</p>
<p>It is also possible to get the stack trace for the allocation which resulted in the memory leak by dumping the <code>bufctl</code> structure. The address of this structure can be obtained from the output of the <code>::findleaks</code> command. The description of the commands to perform these functions, as well as more information on using <code>libumem</code> to identify memory managements bugs, is located at</p>
