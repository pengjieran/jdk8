<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
This document describes changes made to the security manager in the
JDK that allow it to be used as-is as the default security manager
in applications.
<h2><a name="SecurityModelEv" id="SecurityModelEv">Security Model
Evolution</a></h2>
In JDK 1.1, local applications and correctly digitally signed
applets were generally trusted to have full access to vital system
resources, such as the file system, while unsigned applets were not
trusted and could access only limited resources. A security manager
was responsible for determining which resource accesses were
allowed.
<p>The Java SE JDK security architecture is policy-based, and
allows for fine-grained access control. When code is loaded, it is
assigned "permissions" based on the security policy currently in
effect. Each permission specifies a permitted access to a
particular resource, such as "read" and "write" access to a
specified file or directory, or "connect" access to a given host
and port. The policy, specifying which permissions are available
for code from various signers/locations, can be initialized from an
external configurable policy file. Unless a permission is
explicitly granted to code, it cannot access the resource that is
guarded by that permission. These new concepts of permission and
policy enable the JDK to offer fine-grain, highly configurable,
flexible, and extensible access control. Such access control can
now not only be specified for applets, but also for all Java code,
including applications, beans, and servlets.</p>
<p>For more information on the Java security architecture, please
see the <a href="index.html">security documentaton</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="SecurityManagerEv" id="SecurityManagerEv">Security
Manager Evolution</a></h2>
<h2><a name="SecurityManagerMethods" id=
"SecurityManagerMethods">Security Manager Methods</a></h2>
<p>The <code>SecurityManager</code> class contains many methods
with names that begin with the word <code>check</code>. Examples
are <code>checkRead</code> and <code>checkConnect</code>. Various
methods in the Java libraries call a <code>check</code> method
before performing each potentially security-sensitive operation.
The security manager is thereby given an opportunity to prevent
completion of the operation by throwing an exception. A security
manager routine simply returns if the operation is permitted, but
throws a SecurityException if the operation is not permitted. The
only exception to this convention is
<code>checkTopLevelWindow</code>, which returns a boolean
value.</p>
<p>The other main type of methods contained in the
<code>SecurityManager</code> class are those related to class
loader existence and depth:</p>
<ul>
<li>currentClassLoader</li>
<li>currentLoadedClass</li>
<li>inClassLoader</li>
<li>classLoaderDepth</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="SM11" id="SM11">Security Managers in JDK 1.1</a></h2>
In JDK 1.1, the class <code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code> was an
abstract class. The default implementations of the security manager
<code>check</code> methods threw exceptions. The class loader and
depth-related classes were appropriately implemented, often in
native code.
<p>Any application (such as a browser) that wanted to install a
security manager had to write their own, providing appropriate
concrete implementations of the methods that threw exceptions by
default -- primarily the <code>check</code> methods.</p>
<p>Security managers based on the JDK 1.1 applet security manager
model typically based access control decisions on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether or not a class with a class loader (i.e., an applet in
JDK 1.1) was on the stack.</li>
<li>The class loader depth -- how far down the stack was the most
recent occurrence of a method from a class defined using a class
loader.</li>
</ol>
<p>These types of decisions were made by calling the
<code>SecurityManager</code> methods related to class loader
existence and depth. For example, a typical 1.1-style security
manager might have a <code>checkExit</code> method like the
following:</p>
<pre>
     public void checkExit(int status) {
       if (inClassLoader()) {
        throw new SecurityException(..);
       } 
     }
</pre>
<p>Such a <code>checkExit</code> method would not allow
<code>Runtime.exit</code> to be called when any class defined with
a class loader (an applet) was on the stack. This is an example of
the first case, checking whether or not a class with a class loader
is on the stack. An example of the second case (class loader depth)
would be something like:</p>
<pre>
      public void checkCreateClassLoader() {
         if (classLoaderDepth() == 2) {
            throw new SecurityException();
         }
      }
</pre>
<p>This method is saying that the class loader depth can't be 2.
That is, the method that called the method that called
<code>checkCreateClassLoader</code> must not be in a class defined
with a class loader. For example, the constructor for
<code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code> calls
<code>checkCreateClassLoader</code>, which means the method that
calls the constructor for <code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code> must
not have a class loader. This means applets can't directly create
class loaders.</p>
<p>Note that there is a big difference between the two methods,
even though both attempt to prevent applets from performing
actions. In the first case, <code>checkExit</code> will throw an
exception if an applet is anywhere on the stack. That means even
built-in JDK code can't exit the VM if it was called from an
applet. In the second case, JDK code is allowed to create a class
loader, even if it was called by an applet. That is because the
depth of a class with a class loader is used, and not the fact that
there is one.</p>
<h2><a name="SM12" id="SM12">Security Managers in the Java SE
JDK</a></h2>
In the JDK, the class <code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code> had a
number of changes made to it in order to allow it to be used as the
default security manager for applications. In particular:
<ul>
<li>It is no longer an <code>abstract</code> class, and can thus be
installed as-is.</li>
<li>Most <code>check</code> methods call a new
<code>checkPermission</code> method, which by default calls the
method of the same name (<code>checkPermission</code>) in the new
<code>AccessController</code> class. Those methods that don't call
<code>checkPermission</code> have reasonable defaults.</li>
<li>Methods used in JDK 1.1 to determine if a class loader is on
the stack and/or to calculate class loader depth have been modified
in the JDK to ignore system class loaders and security contexts
that have been granted
<code>java.security.AllPermission</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Installing" id="Installing">Installing
<code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code> as the Default Security
Manager</a></h2>
<p>Since <code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code> is no longer
abstract, you can install and use it as the default security
manager. You can do this by setting a system property when
launching the VM:</p>
<pre>
    java -Djava.security.manager YourApp
</pre>
Alternatively, your application can install it directly via the
following line of code:
<pre>
    System.setSecurityManager(new SecurityManager());
</pre>
You can customize the behavior of the default security manager by
modifying policy files. See the security guide on <a href=
"PolicyFiles.html">policy files</a> for more information.
<h2><a name="CLChanges" id="CLChanges">Changes to Methods For Class
Loaders And Class Loader Depth</a></h2>
<p>In the JDK, the <code>SecurityManager</code> methods related to
class loaders and class loader depth are <i>not</i> called by any
of the <code>check</code> methods, and they are deprecated. They
should not be used by any new security managers, and it is
recommended that their use be eliminated from existing security
managers as well. However, they are left in for backward
compatibility and they have been modified in an attempt to enable
old 1.1-style security managers to still work under the JDK,
without modification.</p>
<p>These methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li>currentClassLoader</li>
<li>currentLoadedClass</li>
<li>inClassLoader</li>
<li>classLoaderDepth</li>
</ul>
<h3>Modification of Class Loader/Depth-related Methods</h3>
<p>The class loader/depth related methods have all been modified in
three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>These methods skip system class loaders. A system class loader
is defined as being a class loader that is equal to the system
class loader (as returned by
<code>ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader</code>) or one of its
ancestors.
<p>Since classes loaded by the system class loader include
application classes (loaded off of <code>CLASSPATH</code>),
extension classes, and the built-in JDK classes, this modification
enables these methods to ignore such code.</p>
<p>Note that if you run an application that installs a custom
security manager, and that security manager is loaded off of
<code>CLASSPATH</code> in the JDK, it will have a system class
loader associated with it. (Application classes did not have a
class loader in JDK 1.1.) If you were to call a method like
<code>classLoaderDepth</code> from within the custom security
manager, and that method were not modified to ignore classes loaded
by a system class loader, it would always return 0, which would not
be very useful. Similarly, if class loader methods weren't changed
to skip system classes and a custom security manager was loaded off
of <code>CLASSPATH</code>, then this might also open up security
holes in cases where the security manager is making decisions based
on, for example, disallowing an operation if "classLoaderDepth() ==
2". (It should really be "classLoaderDepth() &lt;= 2".)</p>
</li>
<li>These methods stop checking after they reach a method on the
stack that has been marked as "privileged." (See
java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged() and <a href=
"doprivileged.html">API for Privileged Blocks</a>.)</li>
<li>These methods treat security contexts that have been granted
<code>AllPermission</code> as if there is no class loader on the
stack.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example of the use of the first two modifications, note
that there are now places in the JDK that open files, etc., after a
security manager has been installed. Some 1.1-style security
managers have a <code>checkRead</code> method that looks like the
following:</p>
<pre>
       public void checkRead(String file) {
         if (inClassLoader()) {
          throw new SecurityException(..);
         } 
       }
</pre>
<p>Without JDK code modifications, such a check run in the JDK
would cause a security exception to be thrown when the JDK itself
tries to read a file and there is a class with a non-system class
loader on the stack. With the new security model, all such JDK code
that tries to perform an operation that its caller might not be
allowed to do has a <code>doPrivileged</code> block around it.
Since <code>inClassLoader</code> just examines the stack up to and
including the frame containing the "privileged" code, and the code
at the top of the stack is JDK code, which is loaded by the system
class loader or one of its ancestors, the
<code>inClassLoader</code> method will return <code>false</code>,
allowing the read to occur.</p>
<h3>Maintenance of Class Loader Depths</h3>
<p>As noted previously, security managers based on the 1.1 applet
security manager based some of their access control decisions on
class loader depth. As an example, the
<code>checkCreateClassLoader</code> method previously presented is
repeated here:</p>
<pre>
       public void checkCreateClassLoader() {
          if (classLoaderDepth() == 2) {
             throw new SecurityException();
          }
       }
</pre>
In the JDK we have attempted to maintain the stack depth as used in
1.1-style security managers. For example, the constructor for
java.security.SecureClassLoader has an explicit call to
<code>SecurityManager.checkCreateClassLoader</code> even though the
constructor for its super class (ClassLoader) also does. If the
check was not placed in the constructor for
<code>SecureClassLoader</code>, then a 1.1-style security manager
would allow untrusted code to extend <code>SecureClassLoader</code>
and construct class loaders, as the class loader depth would always
be greater than 2.
<h2><a name="HowToPort" id="HowToPort">How to Port 1.1-Style
Security Managers</a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, we highly recommend analyzing all your
custom security manager methods before running your security
manager under the JDK. Failure to do so could result in a security
hole or prevent the proper operation of the JDK. This is due to the
fragile nature of 1.1-style security managers.</p>
<p>Where possible, you should just use the default implementation
of the 1.2 <code>SecurityManager</code>. This helps give users and
administrators consistent behavior. If this is not possible, then
you should at least try to call <code>super.checkXXX</code> in your
<code>checkXXX</code> method before throwing a security exception.
Doing so will allow the access controller algorithm to be used, and
will allow the JDK itself to function correctly.</p>
<p>In the JDK, any existing code that used to call any of the
<code>SecurityManager check</code> methods continues to do so. For
new code that requires a security check, calls are made to
<code>SecurityManager.checkPermission</code> instead of adding a
new <code>SecurityManager check</code> method. For example, the new
<code>java.lang.System.setProperty</code> method calls
<code>checkPermission</code> with a
<code>java.util.PropertyPermission</code> permission.</p>
<p>When extending the SecurityManager class and overriding existing
methods, some care should be taken. For example, if you override
the <code>checkRead(String file)</code> method so it always throws
a security exception, then the JDK itself may fail to operate
properly. That is, if some JDK code needs to open a file (to read a
properties file, load a JAR file, etc.) then throwing a security
exception for every read attempt would cause such opens to always
fail.</p>
<p><b>In general, you should only override the default methods if
you intend to <i>loosen</i> security, not to make it stronger. If
you want to <i>tighten</i> security, you should modify the default
policy files and/or install a custom
<code>java.security.Policy</code> object.</b> See the security
guide on <a href="PolicyFiles.html">policy files</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>In general, when overriding security manager methods you should
place a call to the <code>super.checkXXX</code> method at the point
where your overridden <code>checkXXX</code> method would throw an
exception. For example:</p>
<pre>
      public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

        public void checkRead(String file) {
          if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
             super.checkRead(file);
          }
        }
      }
    
</pre>
If your custom security check fails, then
<code>super.checkRead</code> gets called. The default
implementation of <code>checkRead</code> invokes
<code>checkPermission</code>, which by default consults the
<code>AccessController</code>. By invoking the
<code>AccessController</code>, system code that has done an
<code>AccessController.doPrivileged</code> before trying to read a
file will succeed in reading that file. All other code will be
subjected to the current policy in effect, and an access control
exception will be thrown if access to that file has not been
granted.
<p>Note, there are some <code>checkXXX</code> methods in which you
should <i>not</i> call <code>super.checkXXX</code> methods when
overriding them. That is because the default implementation of
these methods may not be as strict as the policy you are
implementing in the overridden method. For example, the default
<code>checkAccess(ThreadGroup g)</code> method only protects the
system thread group. If you intend to protect threads in distinct
thread groups from each other (for example applet thread groups),
then you would not want to call <code>super.checkAccess</code> at
the point you would normally throw a security exception, as that
would defeat the purpose of your customized check. Instead, you
could place a call to <code>super.checkAccess</code> as the first
statement in your overridden method.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
      public class AppletSecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

        public void checkAccess(ThreadGroup g) {
          // a call to super will throw an exception if someone
          // is trying to modify the system thread group
          super.checkAccess(g);
          ...
          // now perform checks based on which applet thread group
          // the current caller is in to see if they can modify thread group g.
          ...
      }
    
</pre>
<p>We describe how to override each method in the following
section.</p>
<h2><a name="MethodChanges" id="MethodChanges">SecurityManager
Method Changes and Override Advice</a></h2>
This section lists changes made to
<code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code> methods in the JDK and
provides suggestions regarding any overrides you may wish to make.
Please see the Java documentation for the
<code>SecurityManager</code> class for more information on these
methods.
<h3>protected boolean inCheck</h3>
<p>This field has been deprecated, and any uses of this field
within the JDK itself have been removed. Instead of using inCheck,
you should use <code>checkPermission</code> along with
<code>doPrivileged</code>.</p>
<h3>public boolean getInCheck();</h3>
<p>This method has also been deprecated.</p>
<h3>public SecurityManager();</h3>
<p>The constructor has been modified to allow multiple
SecurityManagers to be created, assuming the caller has the
<code>RuntimePermission("createSecurityManager")</code>
permission.</p>
<h3>protected native Class[] getClassContext();</h3>
<p>No changes. This call can be used to emulate the 1.1 behavior of
the methods that have been changed in the JDK (
<code>currentClassLoader</code>, <code>currentLoadedClass</code>,
<code>classLoaderDepth</code>, <code>inClassLoader</code>).</p>
<h3>protected ClassLoader currentClassLoader();</h3>
<p>The typical use of this method in JDK 1.1-style security
managers was to see if there was a class loader on the stack, and
if not, treat the code as "trusted" and allow it to do anything.
This method has been modified in the JDK to allow trusted JDK code
(actually any code granted
<code>java.security.AllPermission</code>) that calls
<code>doPrivileged</code> to be treated as trusted by 1.1-style
security managers. It has also been modified to skip system class
loaders. A system class loader is defined as being a class loader
that is equal to the system class loader (as returned by
ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader) or one of its ancestors.</p>
<p>This method will return <code>null</code> in the following three
cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>All methods on the execution stack are from classes defined
using the system class loader or one of its ancestors.</li>
<li>All methods on the execution stack up to the first "privileged"
caller (see java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged) are from
classes defined using the system class loader or one of its
ancestors.</li>
<li>A call to checkPermission with
<code>java.security.AllPermission</code> does <b>not</b> result in
a SecurityException.</li>
</ol>
<p>This method has been deprecated. Use
<code>checkPermission</code> instead.</p>
<h3>protected Class currentLoadedClass();</h3>
<p>This method has been modified in the same fashion as
<code>currentClassLoader</code>, and will return <code>null</code>
if the current security context has been granted
<code>AllPermission</code> or all the methods on the stack (up to
the first privileged caller, if any) are from classes defined using
the system class loader or one of its ancestors.</p>
<p>This method has been deprecated. Use
<code>checkPermission</code> instead.</p>
<h3>protected int classDepth(String name);</h3>
<p>No changes in behavior. This method has been deprecated. Use
<code>checkPermission</code> instead.</p>
<h3>protected int classLoaderDepth();</h3>
<p>This method has been modified in the same fashion as
<code>currentClassLoader</code>, and will return <code>-1</code> if
the current security context has been granted
<code>AllPermission</code> or all the methods on the stack (up to
the first privileged caller, if any) are from classes defined using
the system class loader or one of its ancestors.</p>
<p>This method has been deprecated. Use
<code>checkPermission</code> instead.</p>
<h3>protected boolean inClass(String name);</h3>
<p>No changes in behavior. This method has been deprecated. Use
<code>checkPermission</code> instead.</p>
<h3>protected boolean inClassLoader();</h3>
<p>This method returns true if <code>currentClassLoader</code>
returns a non-null class loader, so it follows the same semantics
that <code>currentClassLoader</code> does.</p>
<p>This method has been deprecated. Use
<code>checkPermission</code> instead.</p>
<h3>public Object getSecurityContext();</h3>
<p>This method returns a
<code>java.security.AccessControlContext</code> object that is
created with a call to
<code>java.security.AccessController.getContext</code>. In JDK1.1
it returned <code>null</code> by default.</p>
<h3>public void checkPermission(Permission perm);</h3>
<p>This method is new in the JDK. It calls
<code>java.security.AccessController.checkPermission</code> with
the given permission. Internally, the JDK always calls
<code>SecurityManager.checkPermission</code> instead of calling the
<code>AccessController</code> directly. This allows people to
override this method to provide additional functionality such as
auditing and/or GUI dialogs.</p>
<h3>public void checkPermission(Permission perm, Object
context);</h3>
<p>This method is new in the JDK. If <code>context</code> is an
instance of <code>AccessControlContext</code> then the
<code>AccessControlContext.checkPermission</code> method will be
invoked on the given context with the specified permission.</p>
<p>If <code>context</code> is not an instance of
<code>AccessControlContext</code> then a
<code>SecurityException</code> is thrown.</p>
<h3>public void checkCreateClassLoader();</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("createClassLoader")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkCreateClassLoader</code> should be made at the
point the overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkCreateClassLoader() {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkCreateClassLoader();
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkAccess(Thread t);</h3>
<p>If the thread argument is a system thread (belongs to the thread
group with a <code>null</code> parent) then this method calls
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("modifyThread")</code> permission.</p>
<p>Applications that want a stricter policy should override this
method.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then
<code>super.checkAccess</code> should be called by the first
statement in the overridden method, or the equivalent security
check should be placed in the overridden method.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, the method that overrides it
should additionally check to see if the calling thread has the
<code>RuntimePermission("modifyThread")</code> permission, and if
so, return silently. This is to ensure that code granted that
permission (such as the JDK itself) is allowed to manipulate any
thread.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkAccess(Thread t) {
      // a call to super will throw an exception if someone
      // is trying to modify a system thread
      super.checkAccess(t);
      ...
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckForOtherThreadsFails()) {
        // if the check fails, instead of throwing an exception,
        // call checkPermission, which will throw an exception
        // if need be
        checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));  
      }
      ...
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkAccess(ThreadGroup g);</h3>
<p>If the thread group argument is the system thread group (has a
<code>null</code> parent) then this method calls
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("modifyThreadGroup")</code> permission.</p>
<p>Applications that want a stricter policy should override this
method.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then
<code>super.checkAccess</code> should be called by the first
statement in the overridden method, or the equivalent security
check should be placed in the overridden method.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, the method that overrides it
should additionally check to see if the caller has the
<code>RuntimePermission("modifyThreadGroup")</code> permission, and
if so, return silently. This is to ensure that code granted that
permission (such as the JDK itself) is allowed to manipulate any
thread group.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkAccess(ThreadGroup g) {
      // a call to super will throw an exception if someone
      // is trying to modify the system thread group
      super.checkAccess(g);
      ...
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckForOtherThreadGroupsFails()) {
        // if the check fails, instead of throwing an exception,
        // call checkPermission, which will throw an exception
        // if need be
        checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThreadGroup"));  
      }
      ...
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkExit(int status);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("exitVM")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkExit</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkExit(int status) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkExit(status);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkExec(String cmd);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with a <code>FilePermission</code>. If
the <code>cmd</code> is an absolute path (see
<code>java.io.File.isAbsolute</code>) then it is passed as-is as
the target for the <code>FilePermission</code>. If <code>cmd</code>
is not absolute, then the special target "&lt;&lt;ALL
FILES&gt;&gt;" is used. This target is used because it is difficult
to determine the actual path of the command that will be executed
on an individual platform due to things such as environment
variables, etc.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkExec</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkExec(String cmd) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkExec(cmd);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkLink(String lib);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("loadLibrary."+lib)</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkLink</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>

<h3>public void checkRead(FileDescriptor fd);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("readFileDescriptor")</code>
permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkRead</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkRead(FileDescriptor fd) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkRead(fd);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkRead(String file);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>FilePermission(file,"read")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkRead</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkRead(String file) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkRead(file);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkRead(String file, Object context);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified. If <code>context</code> is an
instance of <code>AccessControlContext</code> then the
<code>AccessControlContext.checkPermission</code> method will be
invoked on the given context with the
<code>FilePermission(file,"read")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If <code>context</code> is not an instance of
<code>AccessControlContext</code> then a
<code>SecurityException</code> is thrown.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkRead</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkRead(String file, Object context) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkRead(file, context);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkWrite(FileDescriptor fd);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("writeFileDescriptor")</code>
permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkWrite</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
Example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkWrite(FileDescriptor fd) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkWrite(fd);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkWrite(String file);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>FilePermission(file,"write")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkWrite</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkWrite(String file) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkWrite(file);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkDelete(String file);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>FilePermission(file,"delete")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkDelete</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkDelete(String file) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkDelete(file);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkConnect(String host, int port);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>SocketPermission(host+":"+port,"connect")</code> permission
if the port is not equal to -1. If the port is equal to -1, then it
calls <code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>SocketPermission(host,"resolve")</code> permission.</p>
<p>This behavior is consistent with JDK 1.1, where a port equal to
-1 indicates that an IP address lookup is being performed.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkConnect</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkConnect(String host, int port) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkConnect(host, port);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkConnect(String host, int port, Object
context);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified. If <code>context</code> is an
instance of <code>AccessControlContext</code> then the
<code>AccessControlContext.checkPermission</code> method will be
invoked on the given context with the
<code>SocketPermission(host+":"+port,"connect")</code> permission
if the port is not equal to -1. If the port is equal to -1, then it
calls <code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>SocketPermission(host,"resolve")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If <code>context</code> is not an instance of
<code>AccessControlContext</code> then a
<code>SecurityException</code> is thrown.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkConnect</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkConnect(String host, int port, Object context) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkConnect(host, port, context);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkListen(int port)</h3>
<p>This method has been modified. If port is not 0, it calls
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>SocketPermission("localhost:"+port,"listen")</code>. If port
is zero, it calls <code>checkPermission</code> with
<code>SocketPermission("localhost:1024-","listen").</code></p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkListen</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkListen(int port) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkListen(port);
      }

<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>SocketPermission(host+":"+port,"accept")</code>
permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkAccept</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkAccept(String host, int port) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkAccept(host, port);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkMulticast(InetAddress maddr);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>SocketPermission(maddr.getHostAddress(),"accept,connect")</code>
permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkMulticast</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkMultiCast(InetAddress maddr) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkMultiCast(maddr);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkMulticast(InetAddress maddr, byte ttl);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call

permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to

overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkMultiCast(maddr, ttl);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkPropertiesAccess();</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the <code>PropertyPermission("*",
"read,write")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkPropertiesAccess</code> should be made at the
point the overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkPropertiesAccess() {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkPropertiesAccess();
      }
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the <code>PropertyPermission(key,
"read")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to

      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkPropertiesAccess(key);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public boolean checkTopLevelWindow(Object window);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>AWTPermission("showWindowWithoutWarningBanner")</code>
permission, and returns true if an SecurityException is not thrown,
otherwise it returns false.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkTopLevelWindow</code> should be made at the point
the overridden method would normally return false, and the value of
<code>super.checkTopLevelWindow</code> should be returned. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkTopLevelWindow(Object window) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        return super.checkTopLevelWindow(window);
      } else {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkPrintJobAccess();</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("queuePrintJob")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkPrintJobAccess</code> should be made at the point
the overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkPrintJobAccess() {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkPrintJobAccess();
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkSystemClipboardAccess();</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>AWTPermission("accessClipboard")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkSystemClipboardAccess</code> should be made at the

    public void checkSystemClipboardAccess() {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkSystemClipboardAccess();
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkAwtEventQueueAccess();</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>AWTPermission("accessEventQueue")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkAwtEventQueueAccess</code> should be made at the
point the overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkAwtEventQueueAccess() {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkAwtEventQueueAccess();
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkPackageAccess(String pkg);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified. It first gets a list of
restricted packages by obtaining a comma-separated list from a call
to
<code>java.security.Security.getProperty("package.access")</code>,
and checks to see if <code>pkg</code> starts with or equals any of
the restricted packages. If it does, then
<code>checkPermission</code> gets called with the
<code>RuntimePermission("accessClassInPackage."+pkg)</code>
permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then
<code>super.checkPackageAccess</code> should be called as the first
line in the overridden method. For example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkPackageAccess(String pkg) {
      super.checkPackageAccess(pkg);
      ...
      someCustomSecurityCheck();
      ...
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkPackageDefinition(String pkg);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified. It first gets a list of
restricted packages by obtaining a comma-separated list from a call
to
<code>java.security.Security.getProperty("package.definition")</code>,
and checks to see if <code>pkg</code> starts with or equals any of
the restricted packages. If it does, then
<code>checkPermission</code> gets called with the
<code>RuntimePermission("defineClassInPackage."+pkg)</code>
permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then
<code>super.checkPackageDefinition</code> should be called as the
first line in the overridden method. For example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkPackageDefinition(String pkg) {
      super.checkPackageDefinition(pkg);
      ...
      someCustomSecurityCheck();
      ...
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkSetFactory();</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("setFactory")</code> permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkSetFactory</code> should be made at the point the
overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkSetFactory() {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkSetFactory();
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public void checkMemberAccess(Class clazz, int which);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified. The default policy is to allow
access to PUBLIC members, as well as access to classes that have
the same class loader as the caller. In all other cases call
<code>checkPermission</code> with the
<code>RuntimePermission("accessDeclaredMembers")</code>
permission.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkMemberAccess</code> cannot be made, as the default
implementation of <code>checkMemberAccess</code> relies on the code
being checked being at a stack depth of 4. For example:</p>
<pre>
     someCaller[3]
     java.lang.Class.someReflectionAPI [2]
     java.lang.Class.checkMemberAccess [1]
     SecurityManager.checkMemberAccess [0]
</pre>
In order to emulate this behavior, you would need to call
<code>getClassContext</code>, and examine the class loader of the
class at index 3, just as the default
<code>checkMemberAccess</code> method does:
<pre>
  if (which != Member.PUBLIC) {
    Class stack[] = getClassContext();
    /*
     * stack depth of 4 should be the caller of one of the
     * methods in java.lang.Class that invoke checkMember
     * access. The stack should look like:
     * 
     * someCaller [3]
     * java.lang.Class.someReflectionAPI  [2]
     * java.lang.Class.checkMemberAccess [1]
     * MySecurityManager.checkMemberAccess [0]
     *
     */
    if ((stack.length&lt;4) || 
      (stack[3].getClassLoader() != clazz.getClassLoader())) {
      if (checkMemberAccessPermission == null)
        checkMemberAccessPermission = 
          new RuntimePermission("accessDeclaredMembers");
      checkPermission(checkMemberAccessPermission);
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>This is the only security manager method in the JDK that is
still based on a caller's depth. This is to allow a caller to
reflect on classes from the same class loader it came from.</p>
<h3>public void checkSecurityAccess(String target);</h3>
<p>This method has been modified to create a
<code>SecurityPermission</code> object for the given permission
target name and calls <code>checkPermission</code> with it.</p>
<p>If this method is overridden, then a call to
<code>super.checkSecurityAccess</code> should be made at the point
the overridden method would normally throw an exception. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  public class MySecurityManager extends SecurityManager {

    public void checkSecurityAccess(String target) {
      if (someCustomSecurityCheckFails()) {
        super.checkSecurityAccess(target);
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3>public ThreadGroup getThreadGroup();</h3>
<p>This method has not been changed.</p>
