<h2><a name="javase7u51" id="javase7u51">Enhancements in JDK 7 Update 51</a></h2>
<p>The JDK 7u51 release includes the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="security/exception_site_list.html">Exception Site List</a> feature provides a way for users to run Java applets and Java Web Start applications that do not meet the latest security requirements. RIAs that are hosted on a site in the exception site list are allowed to run with the applicable security prompts. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unsigned and self-signed RIAs are blocked when the security level is set to <code>Very High</code> or <code>High</code>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Permissions attribute is required in the JAR file manifest of the main JAR file when the security level is set to <code>Very High</code> or <code>High</code>. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="javase7u45" id="javase7u45">Enhancements in JDK 7 Update 45</a></h2>
<p>The JDK 7u45 release includes the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>JAR file manifest attributes are available to enhance the security of running Java applets and applications in a browser. The <code>Application-Name</code> attribute provides a secure title for your RIA. The <code>Application-Library-Allowable-Codebase</code> identifies the locations from which your RIA can be started if the JNLP file or HTML page is in a different location than the JAR file. The <code>Caller-Allowable-Codebase</code> attribute identifies the locations from which JavaScript code can call methods in your RIA. See <a href="security/manifest.html">JAR File Manifest Attributes for Security</a> for more information. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Java Control Panel has an option for restoring the security prompts that were hidden when the option to not show the prompt again was selected. See the documentation for the <a href="jcp/jcp.html#security">Security</a> tab of the Java Control Panel for more information. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="javase7u40" id="javase7u40">Enhancements in JDK 7 Update 40</a></h2>
<p>The JDK 7u40 release includes the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For enterprises that provide a common execution environment and manage the applications that employees access, the Deployment Rule Set feature enables the creation of rules that allow some applications to be run without security prompts while automatically blocking other applications. This feature is intended to be used internally in an organization. See <a href="security/deployment_rules.html">Deployment Rule Set</a> for more information. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a RIA is started, the JRE is checked to see if it is expired or below the security baseline. If so, the user is warned and given the opportunity to upgrade the JRE. For enterprises that manage the update process of user's systems, the <code>deployment.expiration.check.enabled</code> property can be set to suppress this check. See <a href="jcp/properties.html">Deployment Configuration File and Properties</a> for more information. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the <a href="security/deployment_flow.html">Rich Internet Application Deployment Process</a> section in this guide provides a look at how the deployment of RIAs is handled. </p>
<h2><a name="javase7u25" id="javase7u25">Enhancements in JDK 7 Update 25</a></h2>
<p>The JDK 7u25 release includes the following security enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before Java applets and Java Web Start applications are run, the signing certificates are checked to ensure that one hasn't been revoked. Advanced options in the Java Control Panel can be set to manage if the checking is done and what services are used for making the checks. The default is now to check all certificates using both OCSP and CRLs. See the <a href="jcp/jcp.html#dorevcheck">Perform Certificate Checks</a> and <a href="jcp/jcp.html#revcheckuse">Check for Certificate Revocation Using</a> sections of the Java Control Panel documentation for more information. </p>
  </li>
  <li><code>Permissions</code> and <code>Codebase</code> are new attributes for the JAR file manifest that are used to defend RIAs against unauthorized code repurposing.  These attributes are used with signed JAR files for applets and Java Web Start applications. See <a href="security/no_redeploy.html">Preventing a RIA from Being Repurposed</a> for more information on these attributes. Steps 2 and 3 in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/deployingApplet.html">Deploying an Applet</a> and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/webstart/deploying.html">Deploying a Java Web Start Application</a> lessons in the Java Tutorial describe how to include these attributes in the  manifest. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the <a href="security/securityDialogs.html">Security Dialogs</a> section  provides  information on the prompts that are shown when a RIA is started, and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/deploymentInDepth/bestPractices.html">Deployment Best Practices</a> in the Java Tutorial provide suggestions for deploying your RIA. </p>
<h2><a name="javase7u21" id="javase7u21">Enhancements in JDK 7 Update 21</a></h2>
<p>This release includes the following security enhancements for running rich internet applications (RIAs), which are Java applets and Java Web Start applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>RIAs prompt the user for permission to run the first time the RIA is launched. The prompt includes information on the certificate used to sign the application, the location of the application, and the level of access that the application requests. In most cases, users can turn off the prompts for future launches of the same application. See <a href="http://java.com/faq-securityprompts">What should I do when I see a security prompt from Java?</a> for a description of the prompts. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RIAs that are signed with a certificate issued by a recognized certificate authority require a single click by the user to run the application. Self-signed and unsigned applications require additional steps by the user before the application is launched. Therefore, for the best user experience, sign your RIAs with a trusted certificate before deploying to the end user. For information on signing JAR files, see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/signindex.html">Signing and Verifying JAR Files</a>.</p> 
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depending on the security level set in the Java Control Panel and the user's version of the JRE, self-signed or unsigned applications might not be allowed to run. The default setting of High permits all but local applets to run on a secure JRE. If the user is running an insecure JRE, only applications that are signed with a certificate issued by a recognized certificate authority are allowed to run. </p>
	<p>The Low and Custom settings are no longer available. </p>
	<p>For more information, see the <a href="jcp/jcp.html#security">Security</a> section of the Java Control Panel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sandbox applications (previously called &quot;unsigned&quot; or &quot;untrusted&quot; applications) are restricted to the security sandbox. Privileged applications (previously called &quot;signed&quot; applications) are provided unrestricted access to a user's system.</p> 
      <p>For Java Web Start applications, including applets that are launched using JNLP, the <code>security</code> element in the <code>.jnlp</code> file is used to set the level of access. If the element is not present, access is restricted to the sandbox. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/doingMoreWithRIA/security.html">Security in Rich Internet Applications</a> for more information.</p> 
	  <p>For applets that are not launched using JNLP, the <code>permissions</code> element is added to the <code>applet</code> or <code>object</code> element to set the level of access to either sandbox or all-permissions. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/html.html">Deploying With the Applet Tag</a> for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li> JavaScript code that calls code within a privileged applet (an applet that runs outside the sandbox) is treated as mixed code. Warning dialogs are raised if the signed JAR files are not tagged with the <code>Trusted-Library</code> attribute. See <a href="security/mixed_code.html">Mixing Privileged Code and Sandbox Code</a> for more information. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="javase7u10" id="javase7u10">Enhancements in JDK 7 Update 10</a></h2>
<p>
The JDK 7u10 release includes the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to disable any Java app from running in the browser. This mode can be set in the Java Control Panel or using a command-line install argument (Microsoft Windows only).</li>
<li>The ability to select the desired level of security for unsigned applets, Java Web Start applications, and embedded JavaFX applications that run in a browser. Four levels of security are supported. This feature can be set in the Java Control Panel, or using a command-line install argument (Microsoft Windows only).</li>
<li>New dialogs warn you when the JRE is insecure (either expired or below the security baseline) and needs to be updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="client-security.html">Setting the Level of Security for the Java Client</a> and <a href="jcp/jcp.html">Java Control Panel</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="javase7u6" id="javase7u6">Enhancements in JDK 7 Update 6</a></h2>

</ul>
<h2><a name="javase7u2" id="javase7u2">Enhancements in JDK 7 Update 2</a></h2>
<p>This release introduces the following improvements for
web-deployed applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Java SE includes JavaFX</strong>: JDK 7 Update 2 and
later includes the JavaFX SDK. See <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/release_notes_2-0-2/jfxpub-release_notes_2-0-2.htm">
JavaFX 2.0.2 Release Notes</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-blocking installation of JRE and JavaFX using
Deployment Toolkit</strong>: The web page continues to accept user
input while Deployment Toolkit downloads and installs the required
components. See <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7052499">7052499</a>
for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced footprint of signed JAR files</strong>: This
release provides a new signing method that enables you to sign a
JAR file as one large object instead of signing every JAR entry
individually. This saves up to 10% of the total JAR size.
<strong>Note</strong>: Users must run JRE 7 Update 2 or later to be
able to use these JARs. See <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7049193">7049193</a>
and the section <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/deployment/packaging.htm#BABJGFBH">
Sign the JAR Files</a> in <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/deployment/packaging.htm">Packaging</a>
(the information in this section also applies to Java SE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching certificate details in the JNLP file for signed
applications</strong>: For an application that uses security, a
security dialog will present the cached certificates immediately
for user approval while downloading the application in the
background. An older JRE will ignore this functionality; it will
present the certificate information after the application is
downloaded. See <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7049169">7049169</a>
and the section <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/deployment/packaging.htm#BABGGIHD">
Embed Signing Certificate into Deployment Descriptor</a> in
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/deployment/packaging.htm">
Packaging</a> (the information in this section also applies to Java
SE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching enabled by default</strong>: Caching of network
content for application code running in Web Start mode is now
enabled by default. This allows application improved performance
and consistency with applet execution mode. To ensure the latest
copy of content is used, the application can use <a href=
"../../../api/java/net/URLConnection.html#setUseCaches-boolean-"><code>
URLConnection.setUseCaches(false)</code></a> or request header
<code>Cache-Control</code> values
<code>no-cache</code>/<code>no-store</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embedded JNLP support for Web Start</strong>: The
Deployment Toolkit can use a copy of a JNLP file embedded into a
web page to launch an application. This helps to reduce number of
network connections needed for the first start of a Web Start
application from the browser. See <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7052492">7052492</a>
and the section <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/deployment/packaging.htm#sthref34">
Embed Deployment Descriptor into Web Page</a> in <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/deployment/packaging.htm">Packaging</a>
(the information in this section also applies to Java SE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ability to pass secure JVM arguments to the Web Start
application from inside the web page using Deployment
Toolkit</strong>: This helps to avoid JVM relaunch due to JVM
configuration mismatch and also helps to pass dynamic parameters
from the web page. See <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7072364">7072364</a>
and the section <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/deployment/deployment_toolkit.htm#sthref40">
Platform</a> in <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2.0/deployment/deployment_toolkit.htm">
Deployment in the Browser</a> (the information in this section also
applies to Java SE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improvements for handling content with gzip
encoding</strong>: The deployment cache will keep application
content in compressed form and return it to the application as-is
with gzip content-encoding in the HTTP header. This makes behavior
more consistent across different execution modes (first launch
versus subsequent launch, cache enabled versus cache disabled). See
<a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6575586">6575586</a>
for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved support for JNLP applications</strong>: JavaFX
applications are more cleanly uninstalled; see <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7085171">7085171</a>
and <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7053087">7053087</a>.
Recognition of JNLP install hints is improved; see <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7046670">7046670</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Startup improvements</strong>: Startup has been improved
for specific scenarios; see <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7099086">7099086</a>
and <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7098160">7098160</a>
for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New setting, Insecure JRE versions, in Java Control
Panel</strong>: If users have a version of Java on their system
that is below the security baseline, a warning message is displayed
before an application or an applet can be run using that version.
You can control this warning message with the <a href= "jcp/jcp.html">Java
Control Panel</a>
Advanced tab setting, <strong>Insecure JRE versions</strong>, which
will set the property <code>deployment.insecure.jres</code> in the
<code>deployment.properties</code> file to one of the following
values:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" summary=
"Possible values of deployment.insecure.jres property">

</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="javase7" id="javase7">Enhancements in Java SE
7</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The following enhancements have been made to the syntax of JNLP
files; see <a href="../javaws/developersguide/syntax.html">JNLP
File Syntax</a>:
<ul>
<li>The <code>os</code> attribute in the <code>information</code>
and <code>resources</code> elements can now contain specific
versions of Windows, such as Windows Vista or Windows 7.</li>
<li>Applications can use the <code>install</code> attribute in the
<code>shortcut</code> element to specify their their desire to be
installed. Installed applications are not removed when the Java Web
Start cache is cleared, but can be explicitly removed using the
Java Control Panel.</li>
<li>Java Web Start applications can be deployed without specifying
the <code>codebase</code> attribute; see <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/deploymentInDepth/deployingWithoutCodebase.html">
Deploying Without Codebase</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A JNLP file can be embedded into an HTML page; see <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/deploymentInDepth/embeddingJNLPFileInWebPage.html">
Embedding JNLP File in Applet Tag</a>.</li>
<li>You can check the status variable of the applet while it is
loading to determine if the applet is ready to handle requests from
JavaScript code; see <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/appletStatus.html">
Handling Initialization Status With Event Handlers</a>.</li>
<li>You now have control of the window decoration style and title
of an applet launched from a shortcut or dragged out of the
browser; see <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/draggableApplet.html#decoration">
Requesting and Customizing Applet Decoration</a> in <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/draggableApplet.html">
Developing Draggable Applets</a>.</li>
<li>In order to make it easier to re-distribute an application that
is deployed using a signed jar file, a JNLP template can be used.
The JNLP template allows the developer to specify what parts of a
JNLP file may be changed without resigning the main jar. For more
information, see <a href="security/signedJNLP.html">Signing JAR Files with a
JNLP Template</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following enhancements are introduced:</p>
<p><b>Area</b>: Deployment<br />
<b>Standard/Platform</b>: JDK 7<br />
<b>Synopsis</b>: Previously, the <tt>pack200</tt> tool segmented
its output by default. As of this release, the <tt>pack200</tt>
tool will create one large segment per jar file. Therefore, if
deployers have jar files larger than the virtual memory available
on the end-user's systems, it is recommended that either the input
jar file be split, or suitably segmented by using the command-line
flag "<tt>--segment-limit=nnnnn</tt>" or the equivalent property
"<tt>SEGMENT_LIMIT</tt>".<br />
<b>RFE</b>: <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6575373">6575357</a></p>
<p><b>Area</b>: Deployment<br />
<b>Standard/Platform</b>: JDK 7<br />
<b>Synopsis</b>: On Windows XP machines, the default cache
directory is now under <tt>$USER\Local Settings\Application
Data\Sun\Java\Deployment\cache</tt>. If needed, you may customize
it to point to a network share folder for a single application
cache across domain machines.<br />
<b>RFE</b>: <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7012538">7012538</a></p>
<p><b>Area</b>: Deployment<br />
<b>Standard/Platform</b>: JDK 7<br />
<b>Synopsis</b>: The optional applet parameter,
<tt>jnlp_embedded</tt>, provides the option to cache JNLP content
on the HTML page and shortens applet launch time by skipping
network access. The <tt>jnlp_embedded</tt> parameter has as its
value the base64 encoded content of the applet JNLP file. For
example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;applet  width="710" height="540" &gt;
    &lt;param name="jnlp_href" value="launch.jnlp"/&gt;
    &lt;param name="jnlp_embedded"
        value="PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiB . . . dC1kZXNjPg0KPC9qbmxwPg0K"/&gt;
    &lt;param name="draggable" value="true"/&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>
When present, the <tt>jnlp_embedded</tt> parameter value replaces
the content of the JNLP value pointed to by the <tt>jn.p_href</tt>
parameter. The value of <tt>jnlp_ref</tt> is then optional and only
used as a backup when the content of <tt>jnlp_embedded</tt> is
invalid. There are a few restrictions on the embedded JNLP content:
<ul>
<li>The attribute <tt>href</tt> from element <tt>jnlp</tt> should
be relative.</li>
<li>The attribute <tt>codebase</tt> from element <tt>jnlp</tt>
should be empty (which means the codebase value will be derived
from the document base URL).</li>
</ul>
<b>RFE</b>: <a href=
"http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6990877">6990877</a>
<p><b>Area</b>: Deployment<br />
<b>Standard/Platform</b>: JDK 7<br />
<b>Synopsis</b>: As of JDK 7, clearing the cache works as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only non-installed resources are removed from the cache when
invoking <tt>javaws -XClearCache</tt>.</li>
<li>Both installed and non-installed resources are removed by
invoking <tt>javaws -uninstall</tt>.</li>
<li>The "Delete Temporary Files" dialog, in JCP, previously had two
checkboxes, both checked by default: "Applications and Applets",
and "Trace and Log files". As of JDK 7, there will be three
checkboxes, with the first two checked by default: "Trace and Log
Files", "Cached Applications and Applets", and "Installed
Applications and Applets".</li>
<li>Only installed applications will have an entry in the
Add/Remove panel.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Area</b>: JNLP Files<br />
<b>Standard/Platform</b>: JDK 7<br />
<b>Synopsis</b>: In order to support debugging of Java Web Start
applications, the <tt>-XX:HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</tt> flag is
now supported in JNLP files for trusted applications.<br />
<b>RFE</b>: <a href=

<p><b>Area</b>: JNLP Files<br />
<b>Standard/Platform</b>: JDK 7<br />
<b>Synopsis</b>: Previous versions of Java Web Start did not
correctly implement section 6.0.10 of the JNLP Specification. With
this fix, fine-grained values for the "os" attribute, such as
<tt>os="Windows\ XP"</tt>, <tt>os="Windows\ Vista"</tt>, and
<tt>os="Windows\ 7"</tt>, will work as expected. Values such as
<tt>os="Win"</tt>, and <tt>os="Windows"</tt> will continue to match
all Windows platforms. As of this release, <tt>os="Windows\ Vista
Windows\ 7"</tt> will only match Vista or Windows 7 and not Windows
XP.<br />
