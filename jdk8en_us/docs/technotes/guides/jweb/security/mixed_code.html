<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Privileged Java Web Start applications and applets that contain
components that are restricted to the security sandbox could potentially be unsafe unless
the mixed code was intended by the application vendor. When a
program contains both privileged components and sandbox components, security warnings are shown.
Note that JavaScript code is restricted to the sandbox and could also cause security warnings to be shown. See <a href="manifest.html#caller_allowable">Caller-Allowable-Codebase Attribute</a> for information on the manifest attribute for authorizing JavaScript code. </p>
<p>The security warnings state that Java has discovered application
components that could indicate a security concern and recommends
that you contact the application vendor to ensure that the
application components have not been tampered with.</p>
<p>In the dialog, you choose to <strong>Block</strong>, or
<strong>Don't Block</strong> execution of the application
components. You can also click the optional <em>More
Information</em> link.</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Block</strong> button blocks potentially
unsafe components from running, and the program may terminate.
Clicking the <strong>Don't Block</strong> button causes the
application or applet to continue execution with some added
protections.</p>
<p>Raising a warning is the default behavior, but there are options
available to manage how this situation is handled.</p>
<ul>
<li>For users and systems administrators, various protection
options are available. For more information, see <a href=
"#jcp">Mixed Code Protection Options for Users</a>.</li>
<li>For developers and deployers, two manifest attributes are
available. For more information, see <a href="#manifest">Deploying
Privileged Applications and Applets Securely Without a Mixed Code
Warning</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<strong>Note:</strong> If any concepts are unclear, such as how to
modify a manifest file, or how to sign a JAR file, or how to use a
deployment configuration file, see <a href="#info">For More
Information</a> for useful links.
<hr />
<h2><a name="jcp" id="jcp">Mixed Code Protection Options for
Users</a></h2>
There are two mechanisms for managing how mixed code programs are
handled.
<ul>
<li><b>From the Java Control Panel</b>
<p>You can manage how mixed code programs are handled via the Java
Control Panel. There are four levels of control available.</p>
<p>How to access the Java Control Panel varies for each platform
and sometimes varies for different releases of a platform. On
Microsoft Windows, you can bring up the panel via
<code>Start menu &gt; Control Panel &gt; Java</code>.</p>
<p>In the Mixed Code section of the Advanced Tab, the first three options enable the software protections, but
behave a bit differently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable - show warning if needed</strong><br />
This is the default setting. When a potential security risk is
encountered, a warning dialog is raised. Clicking
<strong>Block</strong> blocks potentially unsafe components from
running and may terminate the program. When the user clicks
<strong>Don't Block</strong>, the application or applet continues
execution with some added protections (packages or resources that
are later encountered with the same names but have different 
levels of permissions will not be loaded).</li>
<li><strong>Enable - hide warning and run with
protections</strong><br />
This option suppresses the warning dialog. The code executes as if
the user had clicked <strong>Don't Block</strong> from the warning
dialog.</li>
<li><strong>Enable - hide warning and don't run untrusted
code</strong><br />
This option suppresses the warning dialog and behaves as if the
user had clicked <strong>Block</strong> from the warning
dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final option, <strong>Disable verification</strong>, is not
recommended. This option completely disables the software from
checking for a mixture of privileged code and sandbox code, leaving the user to
run potentially unsafe code with no warning and without the
additional protections.</p>
</li>
<li><b>From the <code>deployment.properties</code> File</b>
<p>The mixed code protection options can also be set by using the
<code>deployment.security.mixcode</code> deployment property, as
described in <a href=
"../jcp/properties.html#properties">Deployment
Configuration File and Properties</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>deployment.security.mixcode=ENABLE</code>
<p>This option enables mixed code verification. When a potential
security risk is encountered, a warning dialog is raised. This is
the default value for this property.</p>
</li>
<li><code>deployment.security.mixcode=HIDE_RUN</code>
<p>This option suppresses the warning dialog. The code executes as
if the user had clicked <strong>Don't Block</strong> from the
warning dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><code>deployment.security.mixcode=HIDE_CANCEL</code>
<p>This option suppresses the warning dialog and behaves as if the
user had clicked <strong>Block</strong> from the warning
dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><code>deployment.security.mixcode=DISABLE</code>
<p>This option is not recommended. The software is disabled from
checking for a mixture of privileged code and sandbox code, leaving the user to
run potentially unsafe code with no warning and without the
additional protections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<strong>Version note:</strong> To take advantage of these security
enhancements, users need to install the Java SE or Java for
Business 6 Update 19 release (or later) and use the new Java
Plug-in, which is enabled by default. To use an earlier JRE with
the new Java Plug-in, you need to install the Java for Business 5.0
Update 24 release (or later) or the Java for Business 1.4.2_26
release (or later) in order to enable the mixed code security
enhancement for those release families.<br />
<strong>Note 1</strong>: Mixed code checking for the 1.4.2 release
is available only for the Windows platform.<br />
<strong>Note 2</strong>: For Solaris, the new Java Plug-in requires
Firefox 3 or later. Netscape 7 and Firefox 2 are not
supported.<br />
<strong>Note 3</strong>: For more information on which platforms
are supported by the new plug-in, see the <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/plugin2-142482.html"

<h2><a name="manifest" id="manifest">Deploying Privileged Applications
and Applets Securely Without a Mixed Code Warning</a></h2>
<p>This section describes best practices for developers and
deployers to protect their applications and applets from being
maliciously re-purposed by replacing trusted components with
untrusted ones.</p>
<p>Two JAR manifest attributes are available, as of Java SE 6
Update 19, for deploying privileged applications and applets. A warning
dialog is not displayed when one of these manifest attributes is
included.</p>
<p>Developers and deployers should check their Java Web
Start applications and applets to determine if they mix privileged code and
untrusted code. If users of these applications and applets may
inadvertently download these applications and applets from rogue
websites, deploying or re-deploying with one of the following
attributes should be considered. Existing signed JARs need to be
re-signed after adding these manifest attributes. Note:
source code of the classes and resources are not required for
re-signing with the manifest entries.</p>
<h3><a name="trusted_only" id=
"trusted_only"><code>Trusted-Only</code> Attribute</a></h3>
<p>For applications and applets that do not require untrusted
components, use the <code>Trusted-Only</code> attribute.
No warning dialog is displayed and an application or applet
that loads a JAR file containing this attribute does not load any
untrusted classes or resources. This attribute prevents a privileged
application or applet from being re-purposed with untrusted
components. See <a href="manifest.html#trusted_only">Trusted-Only Attribute</a> for more information. </p>

<h3><a name="trusted_library" id=
"trusted_library"><code>Trusted-Library</code> Attribute</a></h3>
<p>For applications and applets that are designed to allow untrusted
components, use the <code>Trusted-Library</code> attribute. No warning dialog is shown and an application or
applet can load JAR files containing untrusted classes or
resources. This attribute prevents components in a privileged 
application or applet from being re-purposed with untrusted
components. See <a href="manifest.html#trusted_library">Trusted-Library Attribute</a> for more information about using this attribute. </p>
<p>The <code>Trusted-Library</code> attribute is used for calls between privileged Java code and sandbox Java code. If you have JavaScript code that calls Java code, use the <a href="manifest.html#caller_allowable">Caller-Allowable-Codebase Attribute</a>. </p>
<h2><a name="faq" id="faq">Mixed Code FAQ</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I develop and/or deploy
applications. How do I know whether I need to be concerned about
this issue?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: If you do not use the <a href=
"#manifest">manifest entries</a> and you encounter the warning
dialog when running your privileged application or applet, your program
contains mixed code and is affected.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="testing" id="testing"><strong>Question</strong></a>:
Is there a test I can run to determine whether I am affected?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Test your Java Web Start applications
and Java applets against Java SE or Java for Business 6 Update 19
or later. If you are running earlier release families, you should
additionally install and test your program under 5.0 Update 24 (or
later), or 1.4.2_26 (or later), as appropriate. If you see the
warning dialog, then the Java Web Start application or applet
contains mixed code.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What actions can I take?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: End users can click the "More
Information" link before deciding whether to click "Block" or
"Don't Block" in response to the warning dialog. IT or System
Administrators can choose from one of the Mixed Code protection
options and configure enterprise desktops through the respective
deployment properties described above. Developers and deployers can
use the manifest entries to protect their applications from
tampering. No warning dialog will be displayed when one of these
manifest entries is used.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What should Java ISVs, OEMs, and
application vendors do with their code?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Two <a href="#manifest">manifest
entries</a> are available to application vendors to deploy, or
re-deploy, their Java Web Start applications and Java applets.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>:What versions of Java SE and Java for
Business are affected?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The following releases from Oracle are
affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18 and earlier</li>
<li>Java for Business 5.0 Update 23 and earlier</li>
<li>Java for Business 1.4.2_25 and earlier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="internet" id="internet"><strong>Question</strong></a>:
What about Java applets and Java Web Start applications from the
Internet, do I need to be concerned about those?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Users will see a warning dialog if a
signed Java Web Start application or Java applet contains mixed
code regardless of whether it is downloaded from the Internet or
Intranet.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What if I am behind a corporate
firewall?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The mixed code issue applies. See the
<a href="#internet">question</a> on applets and applications from
the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Is this an issue for Oracle JRockit?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I am using an implementation of Java
from another vendor. Are they affected in the same way?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Please contact your vendor for advice
on their implementation.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the risks to remaining on
Java SE 6u18 (or earlier) to avoid seeing the warnings?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Java SE 6 Update 19 (or later) contains
the latest security fixes and Oracle recommends that customers use
the latest release.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: If I move to 6 Update 19 or later,
what type of testing do I need to consider?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: See the <a href="#testing">question</a>
on testing. In addition, the release notes for each update release
documents the latest changes included.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I am a developer. What are the security exceptions that are added with this enhancement?
  <p><strong>Answer</strong>: The following
<code>SecurityException</code> messages are described for
informational and debugging purposes only. The actual message
contents may change between different implementations and
releases.</p>
<p>These <code>SecurityExceptions</code> are thrown when a JAR file
contains one of the manifest attributes and the JAR file itself
contains untrusted components.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
attempted to open sandboxed jar "+ url +" as Trusted-Only
attempted to open sandboxed jar "+ url +" as Trusted-Library
</pre>
The following <code>SecurityException</code> is thrown when a JAR
file contains the <code>Trusted-Only</code> manifest attribute
and untrusted components have previously been accessed.
<pre class="codeblock">
attempted to open Trusted-Only jar "+ url +" on sandboxed loader
</pre>
The following <code>SecurityException</code> is thrown when at
least one JAR containing the <code>Trusted-Only</code> manifest
attribute has been opened and a subsequent attempt is made to load
an untrusted component.
<pre class="codeblock">
Trusted-Only loader attempted to load sandboxed resource from "+ url"
</pre>
The following two <code>SecurityExceptions</code> are thrown when
mixed components are first detected and a decision is made to
disallow mixing. In the first case, everything previously loaded was
trusted and then an attempt was made to load an untrusted
component. The second case is the reverse condition.
<pre class="codeblock">
trusted loader attempted to load sandboxed resource from "+ url"
sandboxed loader attempted to load trusted resource from "+ url"
</pre>
The following two <code>SecurityExceptions</code> are thrown after
mixed components had previously been detected and a decision was
made to allow them to coexist. The exceptions indicate that a
component name collision (resource name or class package name) was
detected between trusted and untrusted components and the request
to load the resource or class was denied.
<pre class="codeblock">
"resource \"" + name + "\" does not match trust level of other resources of the same name"
"class \"" + packageName + "\" does not match trust level of other classes in the same package"
</pre>
The following two <code>SecurityExceptions</code> are thrown when
untrusted components have been previously accessed, an attempt to
load a trusted component was previously detected, and a decision
was made to allow mixed components to coexist, and a JAR containing
trusted components is opened and a component name collision is
detected between trusted and untrusted components.
<pre class="codeblock">
"untrusted resource \"" + name + "\" in class path"
"untrusted class package \"" + packageName + "\" in class path"
</pre></li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I have a mixed code Java Web Start
application which cannot be easily updated to use the
<code>Trusted-Library</code> manifest attribute. Can I sign the JAR
files in the sandboxed JNLP without having to change the JNLP to
request the <code>all-permissions</code> security model?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, with some limitations beginning
with Java Web Start in Java SE or Java for Business Update 21. The
sandboxed JAR files must be signed in the same way (same signing
certificates) as one or more of the trusted JAR files in a JNLP
file that uses the <code>all-permissions</code> security model, and
the trusted JAR file must be opened by Java Web Start prior to any
sandboxed resource being loaded which shares the same signer. This
means the trusted JAR file must be earlier in Java Web Start's JAR
search order or it is triggered to load independent of the simple
search order by use of the JAR indexing feature. In Java Web Start,
the main application JNLP's JARs are searched first, followed in
declaration order by any JNLP extensions. JAR files labeled within
a JNLP as "eager" are searched first, followed by "lazy" JAR files,
followed by any JAR files labeled as using the "part" feature.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I have Java on my phone. Is that
affected by this issue?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No, Java ME is not affected.</p>
